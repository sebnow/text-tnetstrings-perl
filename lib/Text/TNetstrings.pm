=head1 NAME

Text::TNetstrings - Data serialization using typed netstrings.

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.1.1

=cut

use version 0.77; our $VERSION = version->declare("v1.1.1");

=head1 SYNOPSIS

An implementation of the tagged netstring specification, a simple data
interchange format better suited to low-level network communication than
JSON. See http://tnetstrings.org/ for more details.

	use Text::TNetstrings qw(:all);

	my $data = encode_tnetstrings({"foo" => "bar"}) # => "12:3:foo,3:bar,}"
	my $hash = decode_tnetstrings($data)            # => {"foo" => "bar"}

=head1 EXPORT

=over

=item C<encode_tnetstrings($data)>

=item C<decode_tnetstrings($data)>

=item C<:all>

The "all" tag exports all the above subroutines.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over

=item C<PERL_ONLY>

=item C<TNETSTRINGS_PUREPERL>

Can be set to a boolean value which controls whether the pure Perl
implementation of C<Text::TNetstrings> is used. The C<Text::TNetstrings>
module is a dual implementation, with all functionality written in both
pure Perl and also in XS ('C'). By default, The XS version will be used
whenever possible, as it is much faster. This option allows you to
override the default behaviour.

=item C<TNETSTRINGS_XS>

Unless C<TNETSTRINGS_PUREPERL> or C<PERL_ONLY> is set, an attempt will
be made to load the XS module. If it can not be loaded it will fail
quietly and fall back to the pure Perl module. If C<TNETSTRINGS_XS> is
set a warning will be issued if loading the XS module fails.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 encode_tnetstrings($data)

Encode a scalar, hash or array into TNetstring format.

=head2 decode_tnetstrings($string)

Decode TNetstring data into the appropriate scalar, hash or array. In
array context the remainder of the string will also be returned, e.g.:

	my ($data, $rest) = decode_tnetstrings("0:~foo"); #=> (undef, "foo")

=head1 MAPPING

=head2 Perl -> TNetstrings

=over

=item ARRAY

Perl array references become TNetstring lists.

=item HASH

Perl hash references become TNetstring dictionaries. The TNetstring
specification does not dictate an ordering, thus Perl's pseudo-random
ordering is used.

=item Unblessed

Other unblessed references are not allowed, and an exception will be
thrown. This uncludes C<CODE>s, C<GLOB>s, etc.

=item boolean::true, boolean::false

These special values become TNetstring true and false values,
respectively.

=item Blessed Objects

Blessed objects are not representable in TNetstrings, and thus an
exception will be thrown.

=item Scalars

Due to Perl not having distinct string, floating point or fixed point
integers, the encoded type is a best guest. Undefined scalars will be
encoded as TNetstring nulls (c<0:~>), values which look like a floating
point number are encoded as floats, values which look like a fixed point
integer are encoded as integers, and everything else is encoded as
a string (using stringification).
